"""Catch a rule that changed in one file and not the others.

This is the generalized copy of the checker first written for
~/va-resume-v3. The incident that produced it: on 2026-08-08 the output
format was revised four times in ninety minutes, and a role playbook
carried a copy of the old format for nine hours. Nothing failed. Nothing
complained. It was found by accident. This script is the thing that would
have complained.

It is not clever. Each derived file declares what it derives from, and the
map records the hash of every dependency as of the last time a person
looked at the pair. If a dependency's content has changed since then, the
derived file is STALE until someone either updates it or blesses it with a
recorded reason.

Installed into a workspace as `_shared/check-rules.py`, next to the
`_shared/rule-map.json` it reads. What counts as the factory is declared in
that map under `_scan`, so this file is identical in every workspace.

  python3 _shared/check-rules.py
  python3 _shared/check-rules.py --bless <file> --reason "why no change was needed"
  python3 _shared/check-rules.py --register <file> --derives-from a.md,b.md
  python3 _shared/check-rules.py --register <file> --independent

Exit code is 1 when anything needs attention, so it can gate a commit.
